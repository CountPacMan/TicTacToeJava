## by Daniel Toader
### Date: 2014
#### Description
This was a program I wrote last year while reviewing Java. It lets two players play a game of Tic Tac Toe. Grid positions are kept track of in a two dimensional array. Players alternate turns and make plays by entering a row and column. Visuals are ascii. Winner or is declared when a player gets three in a row. Tie is declared when no player has managed three in a row and all positions have been played.

#####Requires Java (tested on Java 8)

#### Setup instructions
1. Clone this git repository
2. Start the game by compiling and running /src/TicTacToe.java
